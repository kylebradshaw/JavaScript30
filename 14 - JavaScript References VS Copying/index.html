    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; //updating an array will always reference back

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //makes a copy(entire array)

    // one day


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'wacko';
    console.log(team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const dog = {
        name: 'Porter',
        age: 5
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = dog;
    captain.age = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, dog, { age: 100});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
